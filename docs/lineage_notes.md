\# Lineage Notes for HECM‑DIAMOND



This document records the developmental lineage of HECM‑DIAMOND,  

the high‑resolution branch of the Holographic Entangled Coherence Model.



\## 1. Origins

HECM‑DIAMOND emerged from the need to extend HECM’s holographic substrate  

into a high‑resolution environment capable of modeling fine‑grained coherence  

across individuals and populations.



\## 2. Inheritance of the Four‑Mirror Architecture

HECM‑DIAMOND inherits the four‑mirror architecture introduced in CMF‑Diamond:  

empirical, conceptual, axiological, and social.  

This allowed the holographic substrate to represent socially distributed reasoning.



\## 3. High‑Resolution Holographic Structures

HECM‑DIAMOND introduced refined holographic fields, resonance structures,  

and multi‑agent alignment mechanisms suitable for population‑level modeling.



\## 4. Bridge‑Agent and Ensemble Extensions

The model expanded HECM’s ensemble structures to support high‑resolution  

bridge‑agent dynamics, shared bubbles, and cross‑population coherence.



\## 5. Integration with Metadata and Provenance

As the model matured, it was formalized with metadata structures,  

provenance tracking, and documentation layers to support reproducibility  

and scholarly use.



These lineage notes document the evolution of HECM‑DIAMOND and its role  

as a high‑resolution branch in the coherence lineage.
