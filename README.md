# HECM‑DIAMOND  
### High‑Resolution Branch of the Holographic Entangled Coherence Model

## Overview
HECM‑DIAMOND is the high‑resolution branch of the HECM node.  
It extends the holographic substrate into a refined environment suitable for modeling multi‑agent reasoning, collective world models, resonance structures, and bridge‑agent dynamics across all four mirrors.

This repository is an example of an **Active Manuscript**:  
a scholarly artifact that is both a conceptual model and an executable cognitive architecture.

## Lineage
ECM‑Framework (root)  
→ CMF‑Framework (node)  
→ HECM (node)  
→ CMF‑Diamond (branch)  
→ HECM‑Diamond (branch)

## Purpose
HECM‑DIAMOND provides the conceptual substrate for high‑resolution coherence analysis within the holographic environment defined by HECM.  
It supports population‑level reasoning, shared bubbles, cross‑domain resonance, and bridge‑agent structures.

## Four‑Mirror Architecture
HECM‑DIAMOND inherits the four‑mirror architecture introduced in CMF‑Diamond:
- Empirical  
- Conceptual  
- Axiological  
- Social  

These mirrors interact within a unified holographic substrate, enabling resonance‑based coherence across individuals and populations.
